# Engine

The core transport layer used in [Vapor](https://github.com/qutheory/github)

## üö¶ Current Environment

| Engine | Xcode | Swift |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|0.1.x|8.0 Beta|DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-06-20-a|

<h3 align="center">‚ùóÔ∏è<b>WARNING</b>‚ùóÔ∏è</h3>

<b>Only applies to versions <= 0.12.x</b>

If you've installed Xcode 8, you'll likely get an SDK error when building from command line. The following command has been known to help:

```
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/
```

## Quick Start

#### HTTPClient

```Swift
import Engine

let response = try HTTPClient<TCPClientStream>.get("http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/")
print(response)
```

#### HTTPServer

```Swift
import Engine

final class Responder: HTTPResponder {
    func respond(to request: Request) throws -> Response {
        print(request)
        let body = "Hello World".makeBody()
        return Response(body: body)
    }
}

let server = try HTTPServer<TCPServerStream, HTTPParser<HTTPRequest>, HTTPSerializer<HTTPResponse>>(port: port)

print("visit http://localhost:\(port)/")
try server.start(responder: Responder()) { error in
    print("Got error: \(error)")
}
```

#### WebSockets

```Swift
import Engine

try WebSocket.connect(to: url) { ws in
    print("Connected to \(url)")

    ws.onText = { ws, text in
        print("[event] - \(text)")
    }

    ws.onClose = { ws, _, _, _ in
        print("\n[CLOSED]\n")
    }
}
```

## Architecture

#### HTTPServer

The HTTPServer is responsible for listening and accepting remote connections, then relaying requests and responses between the received connection and the responder.

#### HTTPClient

The HTTPClient is responsible for establishing remote connections and relaying requests and responses between the remote connection and the caller.
